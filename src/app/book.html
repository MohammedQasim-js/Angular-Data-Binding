<!--* Class binding - So first, we're going to give a class value in the div, as we can see here, and we
can equate this to a property or method from the component. Now here we need to know if a class
definition has been made for div before, and then if a property or method is synchronized like this,
delete the previously defined class expression, and then the property we define will be added.
Secondly, I want to use a class property of Div, and I want to link this feature to a method or
property like this. So this class property can be properties like Class.online or Class.Active. And
thirdly, we can use the energy class when I want to use more than one class binding feature so we
can use multiple classes using the energy class. Now here too I want to tell you, the values to be
returned from the energy class should be in the form of an object, so we can specify this with a
class property that will add. -->
<div [class]="getClassBinding(1)">
  <h2>First book is {{ model.getBooksId(1)?.name }}</h2>
</div>

<div [class]="getClassBinding(2)">
  <h2>Second book is {{ model.getBooksId(2)?.name }}</h2>
</div>

<button class="btn btn-success" [class.disabled]="disabled">Submit</button>

<!--* Style Binding - define style properties for elements in Angular.  -->
<div class="m-3" [ngClass]="getClassObject(1)">
  <h2><span [style.color]="color">First book</span> is {{ model.getBooksId(1)?.name }}</h2>
</div>

<div class="m-3" [ngClass]="getClassObject(2)">
  <h2>
    <span [ngStyle]="getStyleBinding(2)">Second book</span> is {{ model.getBooksId(2)?.name }}
  </h2>
</div>

<!--* Event Binding -->
<div (click)="onClickDiv()">
  <Button name="first button" class="btn btn-success" (click)="onClick($event)">Submit</Button>
  <Button name="second button" class="btn btn-success" (click)="onClick($event)">Submit</Button>

<!-- KeyUp Event -->
